Under what circumstances should we step off a path? When is it essential that we finish what we start? First, some notions about science.

Science is not just a body of knowledge (though that is an important part of it). It is also venturing into the unknown, and developing the idea within yourself about what it means to really know something, and to understand that knowing something doesn’t mean you know the truth. It means you have a pretty good idea of what the reality of what you are studying is like. You are able to create a description that somehow resembles the reality of what you’re studying to such a degree that you are able to make predictions about it, and those predictions can be confirmed within some boundaries that are either known, or can be discovered, and subsequently confirmed by others without the need to revise the model. Even then, what you have is not “the truth.” What you have might be a pretty good idea for the time being. As Richard Feynman said, in science you never really know if you are right. All you can be certain of is that you are wrong. Being wrong can be very valuable, because you can learn the limits of your common sense perceptions, and knowing that, direct your efforts towards what is more accurate, what is closer to reality.

The field of computing and computer science doesn’t have this perspective. It is not science. My CS professors used to admit this openly, but my understanding is CS professors these days aren’t even aware of this distinction anymore. In other words, they don’t know what science is, but they presume that what they practice is science. CS, as it’s taught, has some value, but what I hope to introduce people to here is the notion that after they have graduated with a CS degree, they are in kindergarten, or perhaps first grade. They have learned some basics about how to read and write, but they have not learned what is really powerful about that skill. I will share some knowledge I have gleaned as someone who has ventured as a beginner in this perspective.
